### Demo of 2D-navigation

We developed a mobile platform with low-cost sensors and actuators. This robot has two brushless DC motors for wheels and two stepper motors for the neck. It is equipped with one camera, one laser-range finder and 8 ultrasonic sensors.

It is able to do mapping, localization and navigation in dynamic environment.

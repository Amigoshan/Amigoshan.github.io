### Development of Graphical Programming Environment for Educational Humanoid Robot

We developed both hardware and software of a humanoid robot. It has 17-DoF, weighted 1.5kg. I am in charge of the software development. 

A simulation and controlling environment was developed using Java 3D. Motions and scenarios can be edited and downloaded to the robot. Other features such as collision detection and gravity estimation are also implemented.

This robot can be monitored and controlled using smart phones through bluetooth.
